subtitle: Machine Learning Engineer (& other)

<br>I am a Machine Learning Engineer working at <a href ="https://www.accenture.com/ch-en/services/interactive/innovation-hub-zurich">Accenture Liquid Studio</a>.
My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for image and language tasks.
I have graduated with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, where my <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.623098/full">thesis topic</a> was analysis of medical images (CT scans) for improving liver cancer treatments. 
Previously, I have finished my Masters in Biomedical Engineering at RWTH Aachen in Germany and my Bachelors in Computer Science & Control Engineering.

When I am not doing ML, I like to spend time outdoors doing sports like surfing, skiing, snowboarding or SUP, or reading fiction.
