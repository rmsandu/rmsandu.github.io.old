I am a Machine Learning Engineer working at [Accenture Liquid Studio](https://www.accenture.com/ch-en/services/interactive/innovation-hub-zurich). My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for image and language tasks.

I have graduated with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, where my thesis topic was analysis of medical images (CT scans) for improving liver cancer treatments. Previously, I have finished my Masters in Biomedical Engineering at RWTH Aachen in Germany and my Bachelors in Computer Science & Control Engineering (yes, both, at once).

When I am not doing ML/Consulting, she likes spend time outdoors doing sports like surfing, skiing, snowboarding or SUP.
