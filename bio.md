**Work:** I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer . My research interests lie in the application of machine learning methods for image and language tasks.

**Education:** I have graduated with a PhD in Biomedical Engineering, where my thesis topic was analysis of medical images (CT scans) for improving liver cancer treatments. You can find more information about my PhD topic in one of my [publications](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/oncology/articles/10.3389/fonc.2021.623098/full). My PhD research has been integrated into a clinical [commercial product](https://www.cascination.com/en/ablasure) at a Swiss medical device company.
Previously, I have finished my Masters in Biomedical Engineering at RWTH Aachen in Germany and my Bachelors in Computer Science & Control Engineering.

**Hobbies:** I like to spend time outdoors doing sports like surfing, skiing, snowboarding or SUP. Aditionally I enjoy reading fiction and teaching new tricks to my cats.
