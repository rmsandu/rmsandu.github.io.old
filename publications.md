  - title: "Volumetric quantitative ablation margins for assessment of ablation completeness in thermal ablation of liver tumours"
    authors: "R.-M. Sandu et al."
    journal: "Frontiers in Oncology"
    year: 2021
    volume: 11
    link: "https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.623098"
    publisher: "Frontiers"
    issn: "2234-943X"
    summary: "Ensuring complete coverage of liver tumors with adequate margins during thermal ablation is essential for treatment success. Traditional 2D visual inspections are variable, so this study introduces a volumetric quantitative ablation margin (QAM) approach. Results confirmed its effectiveness, and the code is publicly available, promoting standardized, objective evaluation. "

  - title: "Accuracy of electrode placement in ire treatment with navigated guidance"
    authors: "D. Stillstr√∂m, R.-M. Sandu, and J. Freedman et al."
    journal: "CardioVascular and Interventional Radiology"
    year: 2021
    link: "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-020-02762-5"
    issn: "1432-086X"
    summary: "This study assesses the accuracy of electrode placement in irreversible electroporation (IRE) for liver tumors using a stereotactic CT-based navigation system. Analyzing data from 51 treatments involving 84 tumors in 60 patients, the study compared planned and actual electrode placements, measuring lateral and angular errors. The findings confirm that this navigation system is safe, accurate, and user-friendly for IRE treatments."

  - title: "Stereotactic image-guidance for ablation of malignant liver tumors"
    authors: "I. Paolucci, R.-M. Sandu, et al."
    book: "Liver Cancer"
    publisher: "IntechOpen"
    month: "Oct"
    year: 2019
    link: "https://doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.89722"
    summary: "This book chapter in 'Liver Pathology' provides an in-depth review of stereotactic percutaneous ablation, a rapidly advancing treatment for liver tumors. Improved CT imaging and stereotactic image-guidance enhance the safety, efficacy, and accuracy of ablation, making it an increasingly favored option among physicians."

  - title: "Image-Guidance for Non-Anatomical Liver Resections: An ex-vivo Study"
    authors: "I. Paolucci, R.-M. Sandu, L.A. Sahli et al."
    conference: "Volume 23 Supplement 1S1-S442, 14th World Congress of the International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association"
    month: "Nov"
    year: 2020
    link: "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hpb.2020.11.449"
    summary: "Non-anatomical resections of liver tumors are becoming ubiquitous because they spare a larger portion of healthy liver parenchyma. Image-guidance systems have been introduced to provide additional guidance, but are rarely used due to their inaccuracy. Therefore, we have designed a new navigation approach that renders a surgical plan intra-operatively in real time using only navigated ultrasound."

  - title: "Robotically customizable thermal ablation volumes"
    authors: "I. Paolucci, J.Hermann, R.-M. Sandu,  et al."
    conference: "IEEE Eng Med Biol Int Student Conf 2019, Magdeburg, Ger B Proc "
    month: "Nov"
    year: 2019
    link: "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?oi=bibs&cluster=14934807716303517746&btnI=1&hl=en"
    summary: "Stereotactic percutaneous ablation is a fast advancing modality for treatment of tumors in soft solid organs such as the liver, kidney and lung. In this study, we have investigated the possibility of creating ablation volumes with configurable shapes through synchronous modulation of ablation power and applicator position, in an ex-vivo porcine liver model."
