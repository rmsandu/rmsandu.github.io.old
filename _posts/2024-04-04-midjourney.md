To be honest, I was never interested in trying Midjourney - sure you can create cool pics, but what could I use them for? After all, I live in a small apartment, and our walls already full of originally painted art that we received as gifts from friends or trifted (sorry, no Bansky here).

That's until I had to teach people with no AI or Tech experience to use Midjourney in a useful way (that could potentially generate payable skills). Now after using it for quite time I have to honestly tell you that I have major doubts about those clickbaity titles from Youtube or Instagram cretors that claim you can become a millionaire overnight with MJ design (can I call it MJ and not Midjourney? Or am I infringing some Spiderman copywright?). That being said I still learnt a lot of handy tricks for dealing with Midjourney and controlling the output.

## Creating incredibly realistic photos with Midjourney


### Using camera lenses, photography tips for portraits and landscape

I find that Midjourney is increadibly good at generating realistic photos. I seriously cannot tell the difference. Especially when all the settings of a professional camera are specified you can get mind-blowing results (National Geographic here I come!). 

Here are some of the cameras you can use:


## Limitations of Midjourney

- If you have a very specific request from a client, company etc., get ready to strugle back & forth with the prompting and variations until you will probably consume all your credits.
- Midjourney still strugles with the laws of physics and counting (see my photo with the egg)
- Text is very hard to correctly generate, especially long sentences. Stick to a few simple words.
- Vary region is still quite buggy - if the region is not big enough it's not going to change anything. If your prompt for the vary region differs too much from the original content of the photo, again nothing will be generated
- Photos of women are uncessarily sexual or sensual (IN MY OPINION). Every time I tried to generate a photograph of a woman she had a cleavage. Like why?
- Refernce URL of other photos doesn't work well, at least not at scaling what you are trying to reference.
